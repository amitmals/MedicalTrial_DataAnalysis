# Medical Trial - DataAnalysis

Our client is conducting research in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they have begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

With access to the complete data from their most recent animal study we need to derive meaningful insights and plots for the client. 

In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
